### [Plugin](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/4ab951dbe6ff6a49e7bc5a23a794eeda76eceafe/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth/index.js#L75-L142)

**Extends: PuppeteerExtraPlugin**

Stealth mode: Applies various techniques to make detection of headless puppeteer harder. ðŸ’¯

#### Purpose

There are a couple of ways the use of puppeteer can easily be detected by a target website.
The addition of `HeadlessChrome` to the user-agent being only the most obvious one.

The goal of this plugin is to be the definite companion to puppeteer to avoid
detection, applying new techniques as they surface.

As this cat & mouse game is in it's infancy and fast-paced the plugin
is kept as flexibile as possible, to support quick testing and iterations.

#### Modularity

This plugin uses `puppeteer-extra`'s dependency system to only require
code mods for evasions that have been enabled, to keep things modular and efficient.

The `stealth` plugin is a convenience wrapper that requires multiple [evasion techniques](./evasions/)
automatically and comes with defaults. You could also bypass the main module and require
specific evasion plugins yourself, if you whish to do so (as they're standalone `puppeteer-extra` plugins):

```es6
// bypass main module and require a specific stealth plugin directly:
puppeteer.use(require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth/evasions/console.debug')())
```

#### Contributing

PRs are welcome, if you want to add a new evasion technique I suggest you
look at the [template](./evasions/_template) to kickstart things.

#### Notes

Word of caution: Due to the intrusive nature of these detection mitigation techniques
they might break functionality on certain sites. Selectively disable techniques if that happens or submit a PR with a fix. :-)

Example:

Get all enabled evasions.

Enabled evasions can be configured either through `opts` or by modifying this property.
