## Installation

```bash
yarn add puppeteer puppeteer-extra
# - or -
npm install puppeteer puppeteer-extra
```

_You can also use a specific puppeteer version:_

```bash
# puppeteer-extra works with any version, e.g. the prerelease:
yarn add puppeteer@next puppeteer-extra
```

## Quickstart

```es6
// puppeteer-extra is a drop-in replacement for puppeteer,
// it augments the installed puppeteer with plugin functionality.
// Any number of plugins can be added through `puppeteer.use()`
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-extra')

// Add stealth plugin and use defaults (all tricks to hide puppeteer usage)
const StealthPlugin = require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth')
puppeteer.use(StealthPlugin())

// Add plugin to anonymize the User-Agent and signal Windows as platform
const UserAgentPlugin = require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-anonymize-ua')
puppeteer.use(UserAgentPlugin({ makeWindows: true }))

// That's it, the rest is puppeteer usage as normal ðŸ˜Š
puppeteer.launch({ headless: true }).then(async browser => {
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  await page.setViewport({ width: 800, height: 600 })

  console.log(`Testing the user agent plugin..`)
  await page.goto('https://httpbin.org/headers')
  await page.waitFor(1000)
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'headers.png', fullPage: true })

  console.log(`Testing the stealth plugin..`)
  await page.goto('https://bot.sannysoft.com')
  await page.waitFor(5000)
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'stealth.png', fullPage: true })

  console.log(`All done, check the screenshots. âœ¨`)
  await browser.close()
})
```

The above example uses the [`stealth`](/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth) and [`anonymize-ua`](/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-anonymize-ua) plugin, which need to be installed as well:

```bash
yarn add puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth puppeteer-extra-plugin-anonymize-ua
# - or -
npm install puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth puppeteer-extra-plugin-anonymize-ua
```

If you'd like to see debug output just run your script like so:

```bash
DEBUG=puppeteer-extra,puppeteer-extra-plugin:* node myscript.js
```

## Plugins

## Contributing

PRs and new plugins are welcome! :tada: The plugin API for `puppeteer-extra` is clean and fun to use. Have a look the [PuppeteerExtraPlugin](/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin) base class documentation to get going and check out the [existing plugins](./packages/) (minimal example is the [anonymize-ua](/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-anonymize-ua/index.js) plugin) for reference.

We use a [monorepo](/) powered by [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#--use-workspaces) (and yarn workspaces), [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for testing, TypeScript for the core,  the [standard](https://standardjs.com/) style for linting and [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html) heavily to auto-generate markdown [documentation](https://github.com/documentationjs/documentation) based on code. :-)

### Kudos

-   Thanks to [skyiea](https://github.com/skyiea) for [this PR](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/pull/1806) that started the project idea.
-   Thanks to [transitive-bullshit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit) for [suggesting](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/issues/2) a modular plugin design, which was fun to implement.

## Compatibility

`puppeteer-extra` and all plugins are [tested continously](https://travis-ci.org/berstend/puppeteer-extra) against all relevant NodeJS (v8-v13) and puppeteer versions.
We never broke compatibility and still support puppeteer down to version 1.6.2 (Released Aug 1, 2018).

A few plugins won't work in headless mode (it's noted if that's the case) due to Chrome limitations (e.g. the [`user-preferences`](/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-user-preferences) plugin), look into `xvfb-run` if you still require a headless experience in these circumstances.

## Changelog

### `2.1.6` âž  `3.1.1`

Big refactor, the core is now **written in TypeScript** ðŸŽ‰
That means out of the box type safety for fellow TS users and nice auto-completion in VSCode for JS users. Also:

-   A new [`addExtra`](#addextra) export, to **patch any puppeteer compatible library with plugin functionality** (`puppeteer-firefox`, `chrome-aws-lambda`, etc). This also allows for multiple puppeteer instances with different plugins.

The API is backwards compatible, I bumped the major version just in case I missed something. Please report any issues you might find with the new release. :)

### PuppeteerExtra

[packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts:67-462](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/2dd01ace8d0b2ae5be71ae0f7495ef8caa967e11/packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts#L67-L462 "Source code on GitHub")

Modular plugin framework to teach `puppeteer` new tricks.

This module acts as a drop-in replacement for `puppeteer`.

Allows PuppeteerExtraPlugin's to register themselves and
to extend puppeteer with additional functionality.

#### Examples

```javascript
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-extra')
puppeteer.use(require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-anonymize-ua')())
puppeteer.use(require('puppeteer-extra-plugin-font-size')({defaultFontSize: 18}))

;(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless: false})
  const page = await browser.newPage()
  await page.goto('http://example.com', {waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded'})
  await browser.close()
})()
```

#### use

[packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts:80-102](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/2dd01ace8d0b2ae5be71ae0f7495ef8caa967e11/packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts#L80-L102 "Source code on GitHub")

The method launches a browser instance with given arguments. The browser will be closed when the parent node.js process is closed.

Augments the original `puppeteer.launch` method with plugin lifecycle methods.

All registered plugins that have a `beforeLaunch` method will be called
in sequence to potentially update the `options` Object before launching the browser.

Attach Puppeteer to an existing Chromium instance.

Augments the original `puppeteer.connect` method with plugin lifecycle methods.

This methods attaches Puppeteer to an existing Chromium instance.

##### Parameters

-   `options` **Puppeteer.FetcherOptions?** See [puppeteer docs](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#puppeteercreatebrowserfetcheroptions).

Returns **Puppeteer.BrowserFetcher**

#### getPluginData

[packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts:298-303](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/2dd01ace8d0b2ae5be71ae0f7495ef8caa967e11/packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts#L298-L303 "Source code on GitHub")

-   **See: puppeteer-extra-plugin/data**

Collects the exposed `data` property of all registered plugins.
Will be reduced/flattened to a single array.

Can be accessed by plugins that listed the `dataFromPlugins` requirement.

Implemented mainly for plugins that need data from other plugins (e.g. `user-preferences`).

##### Parameters

-   `name` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)?** Filter data by optional plugin name

### defaultExport

[packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts:483-485](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/2dd01ace8d0b2ae5be71ae0f7495ef8caa967e11/packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts#L483-L485 "Source code on GitHub")

The **default export** will behave exactly the same as the regular puppeteer
(just with extra plugin functionality) and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

Behind the scenes it will try to require either `puppeteer`
or [`puppeteer-core`](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#puppeteer-vs-puppeteer-core)
from the installed dependencies.

```js
// javascript import
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-extra')

// typescript import
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer-extra'

// Add plugins
puppeteer.use(...)
```

Type: [PuppeteerExtra](#puppeteerextra)

### addExtra

[packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts:507-508](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/2dd01ace8d0b2ae5be71ae0f7495ef8caa967e11/packages/puppeteer-extra/src/index.ts#L507-L508 "Source code on GitHub")

An **alternative way** to use `puppeteer-extra`: Augments the provided puppeteer with extra plugin functionality.

This is useful in case you need multiple puppeteer instances with different plugins or to add plugins to a non-standard puppeteer package.

```js
// js import
const { addExtra } = require('puppeteer-extra')

// ts import
import { addExtra } from 'puppeteer-extra'

// Patch puppeteer-firefox and add plugins
const puppeteer = addExtra(require('puppeteer-firefox'))
puppeteer.use(...)
```

#### Parameters

-   `puppeteer` **VanillaPuppeteer** Any puppeteer API-compatible puppeteer implementation or version.
